\title{Duplicated SNPs}
\usage{
SNP.duplicated(x, by = "chr:pos")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A bed.matrix or a data.frame}

\item{by}{The criterium used to determined if SNP is duplicated.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of indices of SNPs which are duplicates of previously seen SNPs.
}
\description{
Determines which SNPs are duplicates of previous SNPs
and returns their indices.
}
\details{
When \code{x} is a bed.matrix, the data.frame \code{x@bed} will be used.
The columns that will be taken in consideration
Are \code{id}, \code{chr}, \code{pos}, \code{A1}, and \code{A2}. Not all columns
are mandatory, depending on the value of \code{by}.

The possible values for \code{by} are \code{"chr:pos"}, \code{"chr:pos:alleles"}, \code{"id"},
\code{"id:chr:pos"} and \code{"id:chr:pos:alleles"}.
The default is \code{by = "chr:pos"}, which means that two SNPs are considered as duplicated if they have
same \code{chr} and \code{pos} values.

Currently, when using a criterium involving alleles, this function does not consider the possibility
of alleles swaps or reference strand flips.
