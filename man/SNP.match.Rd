\title{SNP matching}
\usage{
SNP.match(x, table, by = "chr:pos:alleles")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A bed.matrix or a data.frame}

\item{table}{A bed.matrix or a data.frame}

\item{by}{The criterium used to matchSNPs}
}
\value{
A named list with one or three members, depending on whether alleles are included
in the matching criterium.
\item{index}{An integer vector giving the position of first match in \code{table}, or \code{NA} if there is no match}
\item{swap}{A logical vector indicating whether the match is with swapped alleles}
\item{flip}{A logical vector indicating whether the match is with flipped strand}
}
\description{
Returns a vector of the positions of (first) SNP matching of
its first argument in its second.
}
\details{
When \code{x} is a bed.matrix, the data.frame \code{x@bed} will be used; the
same holds for \code{table}. The columns that will be taken in consideration
are \code{id}, \code{chr}, \code{pos}, \code{A1}, and \code{A2}. Not all columns
are mandatory (see below).

The matching criterium is specified by parameter \code{by}.
There are 5 possible criteria : (i) matching by chromosome and position
with \code{by = "chr:pos"}, (ii) matching by chromosome, position, and alleles
with \code{by = "chr:pos:alleles"}, (iii) matching by id with \code{by = "id"},
(iv) matching by id, chromosome and position with \code{by  = "id:chr:pos"},
and (v) matching by id, chromosome, position and alleles with \code{by = "id:chr:pos:alleles"}.

For each SNP in \code{x}, the function looks for the position of the first
matching SNP in \code{table}. If alleles are included in the matching criterium
(ie if allele columns \code{A1} and \code{A2} are present in x), the function
also checks for SNP matching with swapped alleles (a SNP A/C would match a
SNP C/A), or with reference strand flipped (i.e. a SNP A/C would match a SNP T/G)
or both (a SNP A/C would match a SNP G/T).

This function should prove useful for data set merging.
